# classpython

I will be learning python basics, and how everything python works, how to automate with python, using DSA, and more. This repo will help me setup a flask server, and more teaching me the basics, and foundational understanding of the way, things work, which will help me become a better ethical hacker, and bug bounty hunter in the future.
