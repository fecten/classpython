# classpython

First time using python the linux terminal.
Also started using git repos to put my code in so that its easier to deal with all the code.
The implications of learning python in the terminal specifically lies in the scripting capabilites of python.
As well as the ease of use that comes inherintly with python.
One key skill that I am going to try to develop us my ability to use python scripting for getting infomation/enumerating a target.
